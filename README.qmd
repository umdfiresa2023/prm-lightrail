## Research Question

## Background

## Data

**PM2.5 Data from SEDAC**

Samirah explain how you get PM2.5 data for each city here

```{r}
#| eval: false


```

**Meteorology data from NOAA**

Landon explains work here

## Estimation Methodology & Results

**Machine Learning to Compare Predicted Baseline with Actual Data**

Samirah to work on this part

We use data before Charlotte's light rail opening to predict future PM2.5 levels had the light rail not opened. We then compare the predicted PM2.5 data with actual data after light rail opening data.

Machine learning methods we used include....

Create training data

```{r}
1 + 1
```

Estimate RMSE from each algorithm

Plot predicted PM2.5 with actual data

**Comparing PM2.5 Changes with Counterfactual Cities**
